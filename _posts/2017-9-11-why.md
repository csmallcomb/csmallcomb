### Why I love web development
1. I love the internet as a medium. It connects the world and provides nearly endless opportunities. Web development allows me to become a part of that larger picture.
2. Programming is like a mix of a puzzle, foreign language, and engineering. Learn the right way to think and the correct way to ask for what you want to happen.. and the possibilities are infinite.
3. Web development, technology as a whole really, is ever-changing. There is always something new to learn.
4. You can code, particularly web dev, with next to no requirements. No crazy software required.
